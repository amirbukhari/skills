# 10. Test integrity — what a test is allowed to assert against

*PART V — ACCEPTANCE · [index](README.md)*

`enfile.test.js` and `enfile-label-sanitize.test.js` asserted against **committed mined data** —
artifacts the engine itself had produced. A test that compares the engine's output to the engine's
own earlier output cannot fail for the reason it claims to check: it proves only that the engine
still agrees with itself. Both passed continuously, proved nothing, and revealed it only when the
data they leaned on was deleted and they went red for a reason unrelated to correctness. The
byte-exact gate (§2.3) is the whole guarantee this project sells; a self-confirming test of it is
worse than no test, because it reports confidence that was never earned.

1. **Correctness asserts against real source, through a round-trip.** The oracle is the corpus
   itself: `compileFileEn(renderFileEn(src)) === src` over actual files on disk. A test of engine
   correctness must never take a mined artifact as its expected value.
2. **A mined artifact may be an INPUT, never the ORACLE.** Feeding a catalog into a test is fine —
   grading the engine against a catalog the engine wrote is not.
3. **Every guard is mutation-checked at authoring time.** Disable the assertion, confirm the test
   goes red *with the message it promises*, restore, confirm green. State that it was done in the
   merge request. An unmutated guard is a guess about whether it guards anything.
4. **Pinning an inventory is legitimate; pinning an answer is not.** A drift guard (§“prefer a drift
   guard to a frozen value”) pins the *current inventory* so each addition becomes a decision someone
   makes. That is not self-confirmation, because a failure is a decision point and the pin is updated
   in the same commit with a stated reason — unlike a mined artifact silently reused as truth.
5. **Sample deterministically rather than skipping.** Where a full-corpus assertion is too slow for
   the loop, take a fixed, evenly-spread sample so the test is cheap, reproducible, and still asserts
   against real source — the full-corpus run stays the build's own gate. A test that skips is honest;
   a test that narrows its oracle to make itself pass is not.
