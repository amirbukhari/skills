# ASSUMPTIONS.md

Every judgment call or assumption made under the autonomy mandate, logged as it is made.

One entry per call: **what was decided**, **why**, **which commit**, **date**. An entry is a
record of a decision that could reasonably have gone the other way — not a changelog. If a call
is still open, it is logged as **OPEN** with what is blocking it, so a later session does not
silently resolve it by inference.

Convention borrowed from `CLAUDE.md`: state plainly whether a claim was **verified by running
it** or **inferred from reading the code**. Those are different confidence levels.

## 2026-08-31 — `lib/skeleton.js` and `engine/skeleton.js` keep their colliding basename

**Decided:** documented the collision, did not rename either file.

**Why:** they are genuinely different modules — `lib/skeleton.js` is the flat structural
skeletonizer (canonical shape string with typed slots), `engine/skeleton.js` is the skeleton
*tier* (a body's control-flow shape as a sequence of statement kinds). Same basename, different
jobs, both live. A rename touches 5 live requires across `pattern-census.js`,
`resolve-imports.js`, `finer-granularity-sweep.js` and `engine/pipeline.js` — which reaches
back out to `../lib/`. That is a code change inside a documentation pass, and the flat layout
was the actual complaint, not the filename. Made navigable instead: `tools/repo-dsl/README.md`
now calls the collision out explicitly in the subdirectory table.

**Verified by running it:** the 5 requires were found by grep across the live tree.
**Confirmed by Amir** in the same session: "leave it, you're right that renaming touches too
many live requires for a documentation pass; document is the correct call, don't rename."

**Commit:** `cbe4e73`

## 2026-08-31 — `package-delonix.js` flagged do-not-run, NOT moved to `archive/`

**Decided:** left the file exactly where it is; added a `do not run` marker to its row in the
`tools/repo-dsl/README.md` file table.

**Why:** it packages a corpus at a path `CLAUDE.md` §1 puts out of bounds and
`.claude/settings.json` denies reads to. That makes it *look* like an obvious archive
candidate, which is precisely why it should not be swept into a doc pass — moving or deleting
something that touches an out-of-bounds path deserves an explicit look, not a side effect of
tidying. `CLAUDE.md` §7 also requires Amir's word for deletions and directed moves.

**Confirmed by Amir** in the same session: "leave your do-not-run flag in the README, don't
move it to archive/... exactly the kind of thing that should wait for an explicit look, not get
swept into a doc pass."

**Commit:** `cbe4e73`

## 2026-08-31 — the naming worksheet stays in the engine tree; it is not a §8B violation

**Decided:** left `name-words-lzw.js` writing `name-words-lzw-worksheet.json` into
`tools/repo-dsl/`. Documented why. Did **not** relocate it to `<CORPUS>/.cache/spec-derived/`.

**Why:** it was put to me as a known §8B location violation. It is not one, and the assumption
that it was would have caused the damage. Three pieces of evidence:

- `git check-ignore -v` resolves the file to `.gitignore:25`, inside a section headed
  *"Wipable-derived per §8A (.calc IR, coverage/index reports, worksheets)"* which lists three
  engine-tree worksheets by fully-qualified path. It cannot reach the public remote.
- `engine/artifact-location.test.js` enforces §8B over (a) the `ARTIFACTS` registry and (c) a
  `DERIVED` filename set. The worksheet is in neither, so it is exempt **by construction**, not
  by an oversight in the guard.
- the only reader is the human filling it in; the apply step is separate and never automatic.

**The counterfactual is the point:** `.cache/spec-derived/` is defined as regenerable and
wipable. A part-filled worksheet is hand-authored content. Moving it there would put
hand-authored names in a wipable tree — the exact failure `word-names.json`'s SOURCE-PROTECTED
status exists to prevent, and one this project has already suffered once. Which side of that
line a half-filled worksheet sits on is Amir's call.

**Verified by running it:** `git check-ignore -v`, and reading the `DERIVED` set at
`engine/artifact-location.test.js:41-45`.

**Also corrected here:** this was attributed to me as something I had flagged earlier. I had
not — what I flagged was `author-names.js` crashing on a missing census file (`CLAUDE.md` §9).

**Commit:** `3ce75aa`

## 2026-08-31 — `b20aae3` corrected with a `git note`, not a history rewrite

**Decided:** attached an explanatory `git note` to `b20aae3` recording what it actually
contains. Did **not** amend, rebase or force-push.

**Why:** `git add README.md && git commit` commits the **whole index**, and the index already
held another lane's staged work. The commit is titled for the README but carries four
changesets: the README, the removal of four skill folders (mcp-builder,
subagent-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion), the
`tools/repo-dsl/PRD.md → tools/PRD.md` relocation, and 10 `archive/` moves plus edits to
`archive/README.md` and `engine/SDD.md`.

The suggested fix was `git commit --amend`. That only reaches HEAD, and `b20aae3` was six
commits back with three of the intervening commits belonging to lanes that were still live.
Checking further: **`b20aae3` was already on `origin/spec-driven-dev`** — another lane had
pushed the branch. So a rebase would have been a force-push over published history belonging
to two active lanes, to fix a commit message. A note carries the same information and changes
no SHA.

**Verified by running it:** `git branch -r --contains b20aae3` → `origin/spec-driven-dev`;
`git show --name-status b20aae3` for the four changesets.

**Also corrected here:** I first reported this commit as carrying only the 9 mcp-builder
deletions. That was wrong and understated — I had accounted for the `D` entries in my initial
snapshot and missed the staged `R`/`M` renames. The full list is above.

**Commit:** the note is on `refs/notes/commits`, attached to object `b20aae3`. Read it with
`git log --notes b20aae3`. Pushed as a separate refspec — a plain `git push` does not carry
notes, so a fresh clone will not see it without `git fetch origin refs/notes/commits:refs/notes/commits`.

---

## 2026-08-31 — the two design proposals renamed on move

**Decided:** `git mv` both into `tools/repo-dsl/proposals/` **and** dropped the `-proposal`
suffix from each filename (`PROSE-en-sentences-proposal.md` → `proposals/PROSE-en-sentences.md`,
same for `SEG-segmentation`).

**Why:** the folder now carries the status, so the suffix was redundant. This is a rename Amir
did not specifically direct, so it is logged rather than assumed. `CLAUDE.md` §7 permits moves
and renames with a clear revert path; `git mv` preserves every byte and both files are
detected as `R100`. Nothing references either file — verified by grep across `*.md`, `*.js`
and `*.json`.

**Commit:** `b6a49bb`

## OPEN — the deleted agent-file batch. Held, awaiting Amir.

**Not decided. Blocking on Amir and deliberately not resolved by inference.**

`.github/agents/rentsync-agent-builder.agent.md` is deleted on disk (unstaged, not by me,
present at session start) but still tracked at HEAD. Its whole `Required Skills` section names
the four removed skills, plus two constraints reference them. There is nothing on disk to edit.

The task was to fix those references. The obstacle is that the deletion sits in a batch of six
unaccounted deletions that read as one coherent in-progress cleanup by another lane:

```
 D .github/agents/playwright-browser-control.agent.md
 D .github/agents/rentsync-agent-builder.agent.md
 D examples/code-review-standards-prd.md
 D examples/engineering-standards.md
 D hooks/security.json
 D mcp/servers.json
```

`CLAUDE.md` §7: *"Never stage a deletion you cannot account for. If `git status` shows a file
gone that you did not remove, leave it unstaged and ask."* Committing one file out of that
batch splits someone's changeset; committing all six commits deletions that are not mine.
Restoring the file to edit it undoes another lane's work, and would need replacement targets
for all four skills — which do not exist and must not be guessed.

Four options were put to Amir. **No answer yet; still holding.** Log the choice here when it
lands.

## 2026-08-31 — `operation-idioms.test.js`'s `catalog/` path is NOT a rename-sweep miss

**Decided:** left `engine/operation-idioms.test.js:16` pointing at `<CORPUS>/catalog/`. I had
reported it as a stale `spec/`→`sen/` miss and was explicitly cleared to fix it. I did not, and
reversed my own label instead.

**Why:** its comment at `:13-14` says it uses the legacy STEP-4 root deliberately rather than
`AC.pathFor`, and its producer `archive/build-operation-idioms.js:173-174` writes to
`<corpus>/catalog/` to match. Repointing it at `sen/catalog/` would have broken it against its own
producer and merged the two catalog trees `CLAUDE.md` §5 says never to merge. Its `ENOENT` is
missing **data**, not a wrong path — the legacy tree went in the hand-wipe.

**Verified by running it:** the ENOENT names `<corpus>/catalog/operation-idioms.json`; grep found
exactly one producer, in `archive/`.

**Commit:** `41daefe`, as a stated non-change with the reasoning in the message.

---

## 2026-08-31 — the legacy `catalog/` tree was not regenerated

**Decided:** did not run `archive/build-operation-idioms.js` to rebuild `operation-idioms.json`
and `function-archetypes.json`.

**Why:** `archive/build-operation-idioms.js:26` hardcodes
`/home/amir/Documents/Rentsync/delonix/hydra-source` — the root `CLAUDE.md` §1 forbids touching,
and which no longer exists. Regenerating needs the producer repointed at `CR.corpusRoot()` first,
plus a decision on whether the legacy tree should come back at all. Design call, not a patch.

**Verified by reading it:** the literal is on one line and is not resolver-derived. The script was
not executed.

**Commit:** no code change. Escalated instead.

---

## 2026-08-31 — every tier flag became `--tier=<name>`, not only the colliding `--corpus`

**Decided:** renamed all four tier selectors in `run-tests.js` (`--unit/--corpus/--slow/--all` →
`--tier=unit|corpus|slow|all`), though only `--corpus` actually collided.

**Why:** the collision was structural, not specific. `run-tests.js` resolves roots in its **own**
process (`corpusReady`, now `corpusState`), so its argv is parsed by `corpus-root.js` — and *any*
bare tier flag sharing a name with a present or future root flag re-creates the bug. Fixing only
`--corpus` leaves three loaded guns and an inconsistent surface. A bare tier flag is now refused by
name with the reason rather than silently reinterpreted as a root. npm script names are unchanged,
so `README.md`'s documented surface still holds.

**Verified by running it:** `node run-tests.js --corpus` → `REFUSED … is not a tier flag`, exit 2;
`--tier=bogus` → `REFUSED: unknown tier`, exit 2. Before the fix, `npm run test:corpus` reported
`0 passed, 0 failed, 6 skipped` with `the corpus at null is not mined` — a measurement of the flag
presented as a measurement of the corpus.

**Commit:** `41daefe`

---

## 2026-08-31 — the corpus gate is per-test, and each test's needs are read off the code

**Decided:** replaced the all-or-nothing `corpusReady()` (one gate over
`["generators-lzw","word-names"]`) with per-test `needs` / `files` declarations in `CORPUS_TIER`.
Every skip now names its own absent prerequisite.

**Why:** one absent artifact skipped all six tests, and four of them do not read `word-names` at
all — they were reported as "needs a mined corpus" while the corpus they needed was fully mined.
A skip that names the wrong cause is worse than no skip. Requirements were derived per test rather
than guessed: `artifact-location` iterates `AC.kindsOf()` so it needs `"*"`; `unit-boundary` calls
`AC.pathFor("generators-lzw")` at `:25`; `word-names` needs the dictionary *and* the names that
name its leaves; `operation-idioms` needs two non-§8B legacy files, hence a separate `files`
channel; `sdd.js` names no root and reads no artifact, so `sdd.test.js` needs nothing.

**Verified by running it:** `20 passed, 0 failed, 6 skipped` → `22 passed, 1 failed, 3 skipped`.

**Commit:** `c02a7f1`

---

## 2026-08-31 — `sdd.test.js` and `enfile-label-sanitize.test.js` stay in the CORPUS tier

**Decided:** both now declare zero corpus prerequisites, which by the runner's own definition makes
them unit tests. I left their tier declaration alone and said so in a comment.

**Why:** re-tiering is a declaration about what a test *is*, and `run-tests.js`'s header says a new
test is unit "until someone says otherwise". A zero-need test always runs, so nothing is hidden by
leaving it where it is — the cost of the wrong call here is zero and the fix is one line for
whoever owns tiering.

**Inferred from reading the code**, then confirmed by the run: both executed, neither skipped.

**Commit:** `c02a7f1`

---

## 2026-08-31 — `enfile-label-sanitize.test.js`'s fake root became a real empty dir

**Decided:** changed `EN.loadIndex("/definitely/no/corpus/here")` to a real `mkdtempSync` dir.
This was outside the three fixes I was asked for.

**Why:** the fixture wants an empty index and got one only while a set-but-missing root fell back
silently. §8B made that a hard refusal, so the test threw at load and its final assertion had
never once executed. A real empty dir yields the same empty index without depending on the failure
mode the contract exists to remove. The per-test gate above made this unavoidable: an honest
`needs: []` stops a skip from hiding it.

**Verified by running it:** before, `RootError` at `loadIndex`; after, assertions 1–9 pass and the
tenth executes for the first time.

**Commit:** `c02a7f1`

---

## 2026-08-31 — a real byte-identity bug was reported, not fixed

**Decided:** left `engine/enfile.js` alone and let `enfile-label-sanitize.test.js` fail red rather
than suppress it.

**Why:** with the fixture fixed, the round-trip assertion ran for the first time and **failed**.
Source carrying `«` or `»` verbatim is eaten by the compile-side span scanner:
`"bad « » ⟪ ⟫ ▶ input"` compiles back as `"bad  ⟪ ⟫ ▶ input"`. `sanitizeLabel` protects the
*label*; nothing protects sentinels in *verbatim code*. That is the byte-identity floor, so it is a
real defect. A fix means escaping and unescaping sentinels in the `.en` encoding, which changes
existing `.en` bytes — a format decision, not a sweep miss. Reverting the fixture to re-hide it was
rejected: that trades a visible real failure for an invisible one.

**Verified by running it:** reproduced standalone with the exact before/after bytes. Exposure
measured at **zero** — `grep -rl` for each of `« » ⟪ ⟫ ▶` across all 1037 corpus `.ts` files
returns 0 files, which is why byte-identity has held at 100%.

**Commit:** no code change. Test left failing on purpose.

---

## 2026-08-31 — PRD split: one file per `§N`, order preserved by numeric prefix

**Decided:** a mechanical 1:1 `§N`→file mapping, numbered `00`–`19`, named from the real section
titles rather than invented groupings.

**Why:** any regrouping is an editorial judgment about a document I did not write, and it makes the
split unverifiable. 1:1 is checkable by line count, which is how it was checked.

**Verified by running it:** the scaffold was regenerated from scratch against the live headings
after the structure changed underneath it, rather than patched.

**Commit:** `712c8fa` (stubs), `19210b4` (content)

---

## 2026-08-31 — PRD migration used mechanical transforms only, accounted line for line

**Decided:** promoted every heading one level (`##`→`#`), added a one-line breadcrumb under each
title, **replaced** rather than migrated `## Table of contents`, and excluded the six `# PART N`
divider lines from the section files — `prd/README.md` carries that grouping instead.

**Why:** a divider line belongs to no section; absorbing it puts a `PART` banner inside whichever
file happened to follow it. Heading promotion also had to skip fenced code blocks, since headings
inside fences are content.

**Verified by running it:** both bugs were caught by writing the accounting, not by reading the
output — 1387/1387 lines placed, and a re-runnable verifier reported 20/20 sections byte-exact
against the original.

**Commit:** `19210b4`

---

## 2026-08-31 — `prd/README.md` is the TOC; `tools/PRD.md` was left untouched

**Decided:** made `prd/README.md` the entry point, did not edit `tools/PRD.md`, and flagged the
resulting duplication rather than resolving it.

**Why:** `PRD.md` was being actively rewritten in another lane; editing it would have raced.

**Verified by running it:** the duplication was closed later by `8c4135f`, which collapsed
`PRD.md` to a pointer.

**Commit:** `712c8fa`

---

## 2026-08-31 — `name-words-lzw.js` was pulled from the archive list at the last moment

**Decided:** archived 10 files, not the 11 proposed.

**Why:** the require-graph closure was re-run immediately before moving rather than trusted from
the earlier proposal, and in the interval `name-words-lzw.js` had become `npm run name` — and part
of `npm run build`. A moved-but-still-reachable file is a regression, not a cleanup.

**Verified by running it:** the closure, re-run against the new npm-script entry points, showed a
caller that had not existed when the proposal was written.

**Commit:** `b20aae3` (swept into another lane's commit)

---

## 2026-08-31 — archived files mirror their original path under `archive/engine/`

**Decided:** put the five engine files at `archive/engine/…` rather than flat in `archive/`, and
narrowed the archive README's blanket claim that "everything below still runs" to "nothing below is
part of the live pipeline".

**Why:** retired code keeps its relative requires (`./operations`, `../lib/skeleton.js`), which
resolved from the original location. Stating the limitation beat rewriting retired code so it could
run from a place nothing calls it from.

**Verified by running it:** `node archive/engine/mine-statement-idioms.test.js` →
`Cannot find module './fanout.js'`, so the old claim was measurably false. Also corrected my own
wrong README row: `archive/compose-expand.js:16` and `archive/build-compositions.js:19` **do**
require `./engine/compose`, and the move made those previously-dangling requires resolve again.

**Commit:** `b20aae3`

---

## 2026-08-31 — commits name their files; never a bare `git commit`

**Decided:** every commit uses explicit pathspecs (`git commit -o -- <paths>`).

**Why:** several sessions share this working tree *and* index. A bare `git commit` swept another
lane's staged work into `b20aae3`, whose message describes only one of the things it contains.
Explicit pathspecs make that class of accident impossible.

**Verified by running it:** `git show --stat` on both of my commits shows exactly the intended
files and nothing else.

**Commit:** `41daefe`, `c02a7f1`

---

## 2026-08-31 — `sdd.js`'s hardcoded `"sen"` literal was left in place

**Decided:** fixed the `sdd.test.js` fixture path to `sen/` but did not centralise
`engine/sdd.js:58,62`'s literal `"sen"` onto `CR.LAYOUT.sen`.

**Why:** `CLAUDE.md` §2 says `sen` is spelled once, as `LAYOUT.sen`, which makes these two lines a
real if minor violation. But `sdd.js` takes `projectDir` as a parameter and requires `corpus-root`
nowhere; wiring the resolver in to fix a string is a larger change than the defect.

**Verified by running it:** `node engine/corpus-root.test.js` → 11 assertions pass, so the
root-literal guard is not silently drifting. Flagged, deliberately not swept up.

**Commit:** `41daefe`, as a non-change

---

## 2026-08-31 — `word-names.json` was not fabricated to turn the tier green

**Decided:** did not synthesise a census or hand-write `word-names.json`, and did not weaken the
tests that need it.

**Why:** it is §8A SOURCE-PROTECTED precisely because a re-mine cannot rebuild it, and
`author-names.js:33` reads a census file that nothing live produces — PRD §Q-7 verbatim. Inventing
names would make `word-names.test.js` pass while proving nothing, which is the exact failure mode
`{ optional: true }` exists to prevent.

**Verified by running it:** `npm run mine` reproduces `generators-lzw` and `mined-library` (the
latter to fingerprint `62b5505498647afd`, byte-identical to the pre-wipe body) and produces no
`word-names.json`. No live script writes one.

**Commit:** no code change. Escalated instead.

---

## OPEN — retiring the `word-names` artifact kind. Held, awaiting Amir.

**What is blocking it:** Amir, 2026-08-31, relayed after he left for the day: *"get rid of that
words file its old we dont need it anymore."* The **file** is already gone (the hand-wipe), so the
instruction only bites on what remains: the `word-names` kind in the §8B registry, `AC`'s
`word-names` home, `engine/word-names.js`, `engine/word-names.test.js`, the `needs` entry added
above, `npm run name` / `name:author`, and the §8A / §Q-7 / `R-PAY-6` text that treats it as
SOURCE-PROTECTED and unregenerable.

**Why it is not being resolved by inference:** that is a change to the artifact contract and to the
PRD's protected-artifact story, not a file deletion. `CLAUDE.md` §7 requires his explicit word for
deletions, and §6 warns that this project has already paid for reframing his words instead of
quoting them. The relay also said explicitly not to chase the three blocked tests tonight. So:
nothing removed, nothing renumbered, the three tests stay red/skipped and now say exactly why.

**Ask Amir:** retire the kind outright, or keep it registered and mark it optional?
